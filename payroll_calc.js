    You have been asked to create a program called "payroll_calc.js", that computes and displays
    paycheck information for employees. The program should compute the gross pay. After it has computed
    the gross pay, it should deduct three types of income tax witholding - federal (at a rate of 15%),
    state (at 3.4%), and county (at 1.1%) - as well as the amount of the employee's medical insurace deduction.
    Finally, the program should total the deductions and calculate the net pay, and display ALL this
    information, including the employe's name. Use the following values:
    
    First Name: Meredith
    Last Name: Fitch
    Hours Worked: 40
    Hourly Wage Rate: $15.50
